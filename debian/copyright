Most of the fonts in the collection use the SIL Open Font License,
v1.1.  Some fonts use the Apache 2 license.  The Ubuntu fonts use the
Ubuntu Font License v1.0.

The SIL Open Font License has an option for copyright holders to
include a Reserved Font Name requirement, and this option is used with
some of the fonts.  If you modify those fonts, please take care of
this important detail.
